How to run?
The program requires specific inputs to execute its functionality effectively. These inputs include:

1)	Path to the external Python: This parameter defines the location where the BraTs Toolkit is installed. 
This is the Path to the external Python installed on the user computer that contains the installation of the BraTS-Toolkit.
Or this path is required to install the BraTS-Toolkit.

2)	Path to data directory: Users must provide the path to the directory containing the patients' data.
Within this directory, individual patient data folders are present, with each folder comprising the following essential images: 
(a) T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), (b) T2-weighted MRI, (c) FLAIR, and (d) contrast-enhanced MRI. 

3)	Patient ID: To track patients data.

4)	Select neural network models: This input allows users to choose from a list of trained neural network models. 
Users have the flexibility to select multiple models and even incorporate new available models into the list. 

What are the outputs?
Outputs are the segmentation files for each patient data. The segmentation is performed based on the selected number of neural networks. In the fusion part of the 
program all the segmentations from the individual neural networks are combined based on majority voting and iterative SIMPLE fusion to generate consensus segmentations.
These segmentations are converted to original MRI data space to get the transformed segmentations so that the tumour segmentation results can be viewed on the original 
MRI data.
